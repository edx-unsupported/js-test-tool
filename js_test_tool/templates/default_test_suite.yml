# JavaScript test suite description
#
#
# To run all the tests and print results to the console:
#
#   js-test-tool run TEST_SUITE --use-firefox
#
# where `TEST_SUITE` is this file.
#
#
# To run the tests in your default browser ("dev mode"):
#
#   js-test-tool dev TEST_SUITE
#


# Currently, the only supported test runner is Jasmine
# See http://pivotal.github.io/jasmine/
# for the Jasmine documentation.

# Paths to library JavaScript files (optional)
lib_paths:
    - path/to/lib

# Paths to source JavaScript files
src_paths:
    - path/to/src

# Paths to spec (test) JavaScript files
spec_paths:
    - path/to/spec

# Paths to fixture files (optional)
# The fixture path will be set automatically when using jasmine-jquery.
# (https://github.com/velesin/jasmine-jquery)
#
# You can then access fixtures using paths relative to
# the test suite description:
#
#   loadFixtures('path/to/fixture/fixture.html');
#
fixture_paths:
    - path/to/fixture

# Regular expressions used to exclude *.js files from
# appearing in the test runner page.
# Files are included by default, which means that they
# are loaded using a <script> tag in the test runner page.
# When loading many files, this can be slow, so 
# exclude any files you don't need.
exclude_from_page:
    - path/to/lib/exclude/*

# Regular expression used to guarantee that a *.js file
# is included in the test runner page.
# If a file name matches both `exclude_from_page` and
# `include_in_page`, the file WILL be included.
# You can use this to exclude all files in a directory,
# but make an exception for particular files.
include_in_page:
    - path/to/lib/exclude/exception_*.js
